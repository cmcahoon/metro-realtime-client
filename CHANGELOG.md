### Bug Fixes

* Restore mock objects to original state after each test. ([49f4618](https://gitlab.com/cmcahoon/metro-realtime-client/commit/49f4618))


### Features

* Removed fluent interface. ([0a9f868](https://gitlab.com/cmcahoon/metro-realtime-client/commit/0a9f868))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Removed the fluent interface in favor of a standard, function-based interface.

The fluent interface was nice, but the library was a bit hard to follow after not looking at
the project for a few years. I'm moving to a regular, function-based interface for the sake
of simplicity.
